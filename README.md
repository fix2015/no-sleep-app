### Key Features

- **Universal Device Support:** Works across modern browsers and older iOS devices.
- **Lightweight and Simple:** Easy to integrate with minimal configuration needed.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Handles wake lock and video playback to prevent sleep on all devices.
- **Performance Friendly:** Designed to prevent screen dimming and sleep without draining battery life unnecessarily.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

**no-sleep-app** uses the **Screen Wake Lock API** (when available) to keep the device screen active. For legacy devices, such as older iOS versions, it falls back to a simple video playback trick. This ensures reliable performance, no matter the device or platform.

---

## üì± Platform Support

**no-sleep-app** is fully compatible with both **iOS** and **Android** devices. Whether your users are on mobile phones or tablets, this library will keep their screens active during important tasks. The library automatically detects the platform and applies the most appropriate method to prevent the device from going to sleep.

---

## üöÄ Installation

Install **no-sleep-app** via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install no-sleep-app
```

or

```bash
yarn add no-sleep-app
```

Alternatively, you can include the `no-sleep-app.js` script directly in your HTML.

---

## üìñ Usage

To use **no-sleep-app**, instantiate the library and call its `enable()` and `disable()` methods to start and stop preventing sleep mode:

```javascript
import NoSleepApp from 'no-sleep-app';

const noSleep = new NoSleepApp();

// Enable to prevent sleep
noSleep.enable();

// Disable to allow the device to go to sleep
noSleep.disable();
```

Check whether **no-sleep-app** is currently active:

```javascript
if (noSleep.isEnabled) {
  console.log('NoSleep is enabled');
} else {
  console.log('NoSleep is disabled');
}
```

## üîß New Feature:

With the latest update to **no-sleep-app**, a set of **default options** has been introduced to make customization easier when you instantiate the library without providing specific configuration options.

### ‚úÖ **Easy Customization:** Use default options for basic functionality or modify them to suit your needs.  
üõ†Ô∏è **Control Behavior:** Configure how the app prevents sleep with options for strategies, retry intervals, and fallback mechanisms.  
‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible and Reliable:** Choose the Wake Lock strategy, set retry intervals, and enable or disable fallbacks based on device capabilities.  
‚ö° **Performance Optimization:** Control when and how often the app retries to ensure the best experience without unnecessary retries.

```javascript
const defaultOptions = {
  strategy: ''wakeLock'|'video'|'legacy'',   // Default strategy is wakeLock
  retryInterval: 10000,    // Default retry interval is 10 seconds
  fallbackEnabled: true,   // Default fallback is enabled
};
```

### üîß **What You Can Control with `defaultOptions`**

- **`strategy: ''wakeLock'|'video'|'legacy'}'`**
  
- **`retryInterval: 10000`**: Control how often the library retries to enable the Wake Lock API if it initially fails. By default, it will retry every **10 seconds**.

- **`fallbackEnabled: true`**: Enable or disable fallback mechanisms, such as video playback, when Wake Lock isn't supported. By default, this is set to **true**.

```javascript
import NoSleepApp from 'no-sleep-app';

// Instantiate with default options
const noSleep = new NoSleepApp( {
  strategy: 'wakeLock',
  retryInterval: 10000,  
  fallbackEnabled: true,  
});
```

### üîÑ Customize `defaultOptions`:

If you want to modify the default behavior, simply pass custom options during initialization:

```javascript
const customOptions = {
  strategy: 'video',   // Use video strategy instead of wakeLock
  retryInterval: 5000,  // Retry every 5 seconds
  fallbackEnabled: false, // Disable fallback mechanisms
};

const noSleep = new NoSleepApp(customOptions);

noSleep.enable();
```

This makes it easy to control how **no-sleep-app** behaves across different devices and platforms!
